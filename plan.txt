Requirments:

- a way to add in books.
- a way to remove added books
- a way to remember previously added books even if tab is closed.
- a way to save current state.


Implementation:

display books as an unordered list.
each bullet point will have a remove button next to it.
each bullet point will have a unique id.
i will have a dictionary that will store each id and its corresponding book.
I will get stored books first and display them giving each one an id number and storing them in the "have" set.
I will then allow the user to add books and will give that book the next id number.
If the save button is pressed. I will go over the id's in my have set and update the storage with the books that I have.
There is no need to store anything other than the book names.

for storage I have two options:

- local storage: storing the list of books as a string an retieving them later..
- IndexDb: ?

I might upgrade a project and use an actual db.

for now I will impolement local storage.
